## Latest Completed Task

A relationship-intelligence quality pass, deployed and live-verified on
Independent Staging: stopped surfacing weak machine-generated content as
if it were real relationship intelligence, end to end (extraction ->
snapshot -> recommendation -> presentation). Root cause was entirely
upstream in `lib/capture/interaction.ts`'s extraction, so one fix there
flows through to every consumer (donor page, Meeting Brief, Assistant,
capture preview):
1. `mentionedPeople()` no longer misclassifies channel/CRM verbs
   (Messaged, Called, Solicited, and others) as people -- consolidated
   verb list plus a structural check (a bare capitalized word followed by
   "about"/"regarding"/"with"/"via" is a verb, not a name) and exclusion
   of modal auxiliaries/days-of-week/indefinite pronouns as closed
   grammatical classes. Also fixed organization matching to recognize
   keyword-first yeshiva names ("Yeshivas Ner Yisroel"), which the
   original qualifier-first-only regex couldn't capture at all.
2. The category-label "topics" field (e.g. "Personal update", a coarse
   classifier output, not a fact) was replaced with `specificFacts` --
   real quoted sentences from the note, reusing the same keyword signals
   but returning the matched sentence instead of a fixed label.
3. Relationship Snapshot / `donors.relationship_summary` is now natural
   language (or `null` when nothing specific was found) -- never a
   field-label dump, never a manufactured "Review this note before the
   next interaction" placeholder.
4. Suggested Action (`relationship_opportunity`/`solicit` candidates) no
   longer echoes a field-label dump wholesale, and no longer leaks the
   raw DB field name `relationship_summary/institutional_memory:` into
   evidence text.
5. The internal "Confidence: medium" label is gone from the Suggested
   Action detail view (donor page and Meeting Brief); timing still shows
   on its own when present.
6. The capture-form preview only offers the "Use this relationship
   snapshot" opt-in when something meaningful was actually extracted;
   shows "No meaningful relationship details detected." otherwise, so a
   fundraiser is never asked to manually reject generation garbage.

No existing `relationship_summary`/`institutional_memory` rows were
rewritten or backfilled -- this only changes generation going forward.

Relevant commits (all on `feature/independent-cloudflare-sandbox`, all
pushed):

- Text Message type (migration 0031 + app-layer propagation + tests): `1c2273537403f790f9670f468125606f312b5c43`
- Mobile UX fixes (recommendation wording/layout, shared-edit clarity, RecipientPicker overlap): `aa2a8b7c858acb984358da8a82c2d580734f1222`
- Relationship-intelligence quality pass (extraction/snapshot/recommendation/preview quality gate): `1487a8bb4416666e79a8d94d571e3445af3fc2af` (current HEAD)

For behavior detail: `git show c42cca3` / `git show 391a509` / `git show
1c22735` / `git show aa2a8b7` / `git show 1487a8b` (self-contained commit
messages), plus `tests/shared-activity-ux.test.mjs`,
`tests/text-message-type.test.mjs`, `tests/mobile-ux-fixes.test.mjs`, and
`tests/relationship-quality.test.mjs`.

## Relationship-Summary Cleanup Audit (Phase 1 applied; 5 donors still pending review)

Follows on from the "Existing (pre-fix) `relationship_summary`/
`institutional_memory` rows" item in Outstanding Work below. Two-phase
task: (1) `fe35859` -- a read-only AUDIT -> PREVIEW -> CLASSIFY pass
against `fundraising-os-staging-db` to find remaining pre-fix (`1487a8b`)
machine-generated junk; (2) `7874d6b` -- an explicitly-approved APPLY of
the 4 SAFE_TO_REGENERATE rows the preview found, plus a read-only
investigation of the 5 NEEDS_REVIEW rows (not modified).

Tooling: `scripts/relationship-summary-cleanup-preview.mjs`. Preview:
`pnpm run cleanup:relationship-summary-preview`. Apply (explicit donor-ID
allowlist only, never a caller-supplied replacement string): `node
scripts/relationship-summary-cleanup-preview.mjs --apply <id1,id2,...>`.
Tested by `tests/relationship-summary-cleanup-preview.test.mjs` (12-item
classification coverage) and `tests/relationship-summary-apply.test.mjs`
(12-item apply-mode safety coverage, offline against synthetic fixtures).

Provenance (unchanged from Phase 1): donors.relationship_summary/
institutional_memory have no field-level provenance column, but all 4
real write paths (`app/api/interactions/route.ts`,
`app/api/interactions/[id]/route.ts`,
`app/api/interactions/[id]/outcome/route.ts`,
`app/api/import/monday/commit/route.ts`'s `confirm_contact` action) go
through the same `extractInteraction()` -- no manual free-text entry path
exists for either field. Old-format values are identified by a structural
signature (the pre-fix generator's unconditional `"Latest discussion
topics: "` prefix), not a guess. `institutional_memory`'s field
construction is byte-for-byte identical before/after `1487a8b` and was
never written by this task (see Applied Regenerations below for how that
was verified). No audit/history table covers either field
(`donor_contact_audits` is scoped to contact fields only) -- per
instruction, no new audit subsystem was built solely for this cleanup;
traceability instead comes from: a deterministic, tested tool; an
explicit approved-donor-ID allowlist; printed before/after per donor;
this handoff's execution report; and the commit SHA (`7874d6b`).

### Applied Regenerations (4 of 4, staging, verified)

Re-verified against a **fresh** classification (a brand-new
`wrangler d1 execute --remote` read) immediately before writing --
identical to the original preview: same 4 donor IDs, same source
interactions, same proposed values, no new/removed candidates. Applied
via `--apply` with exactly these 4 IDs; 4 applied, 0 failed closed.

| Donor | Before | After | Source interaction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dr. & Mrs. Yaakov Abdelhak (`e4626eea-56ce-4005-96db-eeafbfde6628`) | `Latest discussion topics: Event planning.\nPeople mentioned: Personal, Teaneck.\nRecommended next action: Review this note before the next interaction.` | `Personal invite to Teaneck event.` | `monday-interaction-81662eab` (note, 2024-09-02) |
| Dr. & Mrs. Gavin Horn (`cd4fbfd1-a461-4954-b580-64d3585f9cb9`) | `Latest discussion topics: Personal update.\nPeople mentioned: Messaged.\nOrganizations mentioned: Yeshiva.\nRecommended next action: Review this note before the next interaction.` | `Messaged to welcome son back to Yeshiva.` | `56d24b22-de8d-462d-9c9e-6e8791b60189` (text, 2026-08-16) |
| Mr. & Mrs. Dovie Weinschneider (`9a9e3a1f-50d6-42b6-b986-c7608f0b8e8e`) | `Latest discussion topics: Giving follow-up.\nPeople mentioned: Discussed Kollel.\nCommitments: ...\nOpen follow-ups: follow up after succos.\nRecommended next action: follow up after succos.` | `Discussed Kollel donation and said to follow up after succos.` | `ccd22502-beff-4db5-88aa-1d2426383271` (call, 2026-08-17) |
| Mr. & Mrs. Tzvi Shlionsky (`2a1735d2-c3a6-4707-beb9-9ac7a0ab4e34`) | `Latest discussion topics: Personal update.\nPeople mentioned: Sent.\nRecommended next action: Review this note before the next interaction.` | `Sent him an email with photo of his son.` | `monday-interaction-5e36f7aa` (note, 2025-06-16) |

**How the write works** (`planApply`/`executePlan` in the tool): re-reads
and re-classifies fresh from D1 immediately before writing; a donor is
written only if its ID is in the explicit approved list AND it currently
(this fresh read) classifies SAFE_TO_REGENERATE; the write is a
conditional `UPDATE donors SET relationship_summary = <current extractor
output> WHERE id = <id> AND relationship_summary = <exact value just
read>` (compare-and-swap -- fails closed, no write, if the stored value
changed since the read); only `relationship_summary` is ever assigned.
Values are hex-blob-encoded (`CAST(X'...' AS TEXT)`) in the generated SQL
-- **found and fixed live**: the pre-fix values contain literal newlines,
which broke `wrangler d1 execute --command`'s Windows shell-argument
parsing (a real SQLITE_ERROR, no write occurred, caught and fixed before
any donor was touched); a `--file`-based alternative was tried and
rejected after discovering its JSON response's `meta.changes` is NOT a
trustworthy per-row count (verified live: an UPDATE targeting a
nonexistent donor id still came back `changes: 1`) -- unsafe for the
compare-and-swap check, so apply mode stays on `--command` mode with
hex-encoded values instead.

**Post-write verification** (all independently re-checked against live
staging after the write, read-only):
- `relationship_summary` for all 4 donors read back and matches the
  applied value exactly (and matches `actionableRelationshipSnapshot`
  computed fresh from the source note).
- `institutional_memory` for all 4 donors: the generated UPDATE
  statement's SQL never references `institutional_memory` (mechanically
  impossible for this write to have touched it -- also asserted by
  `tests/relationship-summary-cleanup-preview.test.mjs`); current stored
  values remain consistent with each donor's known source-interaction
  note (e.g. Abdelhak: `"Note context: Personal invite to Teaneck
  event"`).
- All 4 source interactions re-read: same `donor_id`/`type`/`occurred_at`
  as traced during classification -- unchanged.
- Table-wide: `relationship_summary` non-null count is still 9 (was 9
  before) -- no row nulled, no new candidate appeared.
- Re-running the preview immediately after: `SAFE_TO_REGENERATE: 0`,
  `ALREADY_GOOD: 4` (exactly these 4 donors, reclassified), `NEEDS_REVIEW:
  5` (identical to before, same donors/reasons) -- confirms exactly these
  4 rows changed, nothing else did, and the tool is idempotent (won't
  re-propose them).

### NEEDS_REVIEW Investigation (5 of 5, read-only -- NOT modified)

**Klein / Pfeiffer / Rovinsky** (all three stored "People mentioned:
Solicited." -- the false-person extraction the user specifically asked to
re-investigate). Each donor has exactly one interaction on file, a
Monday-imported note, and the underlying note **does** contain a real
fundraising fact beyond the bogus person -- clearing to null would lose
it:
- Klein (`b5e8cc18-...`): `"Solicited for a plaque ($5k)"` (note,
  2025-11-06)
- Pfeiffer (`d1b9cf78-...`): `"Solicited for $10k"` (note, 2025-09-15)
- Rovinsky (`952a1cc7-...`): `"Solicited for a plaque in memory of his
  wife ($5k)"` (note, 2025-09-29)

The current extractor returns `null` for all three (`specificFacts: []`,
`people: []`) -- it has no fact-signal keyword for "solicited"/dollar
amounts, so **regenerating with the current extractor as-is would produce
an empty relationship_summary, silently discarding the ask amount**. Not
a script bug: confirmed by direct git-history tracing that these 3 rows'
"Solicited" exclusion behavior predates the earliest retrievable
extractor version (`e1760c6~1` had no CRM-status-verb exclusion at all),
consistent with genuinely older data.
**Recommendation**: do NOT auto-clear or auto-regenerate. A human should
manually set relationship_summary to the underlying ask fact -- e.g.
`"Solicited for a plaque ($5k)."` / `"Solicited for $10k."` / `"Solicited
for a plaque in memory of his wife ($5k)."` -- these are already clean,
single-sentence facts once the false "People mentioned:" label is
dropped; no extractor change is required to write them by hand.

**Semmelman** (`5c35437c-...`): source interaction `544721ad-...`
(personal, 2026-08-07), note: `"Sent text on wife's Yahrtzeit to
acknowledge it"` (subject: "Yahrtzeit text"). Current extractor: `null`,
misdetects "Yahrtzeit" as a false person (same bug class as
"Messaged"/"Solicited", just not yet in the exclusion list). **Checked
whether the underlying fact is already tracked elsewhere**: yes -- this
donor already has a first-class row in the dedicated `yahrtzeits` table
(`deceased_name_english: "Esther"`, `relationship: "Wife"`, `hebrew_month:
"Av"`, `hebrew_day: 23`). The durable fact (wife's Yahrtzeit date) is
already correctly tracked in its purpose-built table; what this
interaction adds is only that *this particular touch* (a text
acknowledging it) happened -- temporary interaction context, not new
durable data. **Recommendation**: leave relationship_summary null/cleared
for this donor (a human call, not automated in this task) rather than
manually re-typing a fact that duplicates the yahrtzeits table.

**Zachter** (`19af69d6-...`): source interaction `8b502028-...` (text,
2026-08-18), note: `"Texted video from first day of Zman and thanked him
for his support that makes it happen"`. Current extractor: `null`,
misdetects "Zman" as a false person. No dedicated table tracks
institutional calendar milestones like "Zman" (unlike Yahrtzeit/birthday/
anniversary, which do have dedicated tables) -- this is routine
stewardship-acknowledgment language tied to a recurring yeshiva calendar
event, not a durable donor-specific fact. **Recommendation**: a human
should decide case-by-case; a reasonable manual value would be a short
paraphrase like `"Thanked for supporting the yeshiva's Zman."`, but this
is lower-value/more borderline than the three solicitation-amount cases
above.

### Part C -- Extractor Expansion Recommendation (not implemented)

Narrow assessment of whether `lib/capture/interaction.ts`'s
`FACT_SIGNAL_PATTERN` should be expanded to recognize Yahrtzeit, Zman, and
explicit dollar amounts. **Not implemented in this task.** Distinguishing
by category:

1. **Yahrtzeit-related facts -- durable, but already tracked elsewhere.**
   The `yahrtzeits` table (schema confirmed, and confirmed populated for
   the one case investigated) is the correct, purpose-built home for this
   durable fact (Hebrew-calendar-aware recurrence, editable, its own
   `yahrtzeitChanges` audit trail). Adding a generic "Yahrtzeit" keyword
   to `specificFacts` would duplicate/risk drifting from that table rather
   than add new information. **Recommendation: do not add** a generic
   Yahrtzeit fact-signal keyword; if anything, the donor page's existing
   Yahrtzeit surfacing (see `relationship-date-events`/`important-dates`
   tests) is the right place to make this more visible, not
   relationship_summary.
2. **Zman/yeshiva timing context -- temporary interaction context, not a
   durable relationship fact.** No dedicated table exists for it (nor
   should one, necessarily -- it's an institutional calendar event, not
   donor-specific data), but it's also not obviously worth a standing
   fact-signal keyword: promoting every "Zman"/holiday-adjacent mention
   risks pulling in routine liturgical-calendar chatter as if it were a
   special donor insight. **Recommendation: do not add** a generic
   keyword; treat these on a case-by-case manual basis (as done for
   Zachter above) rather than automating.
3. **Explicit solicitation/donation amounts ("$5k", "$10,000", etc.) --
   giving/solicitation information that currently has nowhere else to
   live.** Confirmed via schema: `giving_activities` only tracks
   confirmed/imported financial gifts (JL Solutions is the system of
   record per `docs/FUNDRAISING_OS_PRINCIPLES.md`); there is no dedicated
   pledge/ask/solicitation-tracking table. Unlike Yahrtzeit, a solicitation
   amount genuinely has no other home today, and per this task's own
   investigation, silently regenerating with the current extractor would
   discard it (all 3 Solicited cases above). **Recommendation: this is the
   one category worth a real product decision** -- either (a) add narrow,
   carefully-scoped dollar-amount fact-signal support (risk: false
   positives on incidental dollar mentions unrelated to a live ask, and
   scope creep toward relationship_summary becoming a pledge tracker,
   which `FUNDRAISING_OS_PRINCIPLES.md` explicitly warns against -- "not a
   full CRM... accounting system"), or (b) build a small, purpose-built
   "solicitation/ask" field or table (mirroring how Yahrtzeit got its own
   table) so this data doesn't have to route through free-text extraction
   at all. Not implemented here -- flagged for a separate, explicit
   decision.

Challenge to the premise: none of these three categories should be
treated the same way. Yahrtzeit is durable but has its own home already;
Zman is temporary/low-value; solicitation amounts are durable, giving-
adjacent, and currently homeless. relationship_summary should stay a
concise "what should I know" surface, not become a generic interaction-
note dump for all three.

## Important Product Decisions

Durable — do not accidentally reverse these:

- Shared multi-donor activities use one canonical `shared_activities`
  parent plus per-donor `interactions` rows, not a fully normalized join
  table or per-donor row cloning.
- `role='recipient'` = broadcast/outbound recipients (text, email,
  photo/update sent to many).
- `role='participant'` = actual participants (shared meeting/call).
- Recipient touches update Last Contact.
- Recipient touches do NOT suppress substantive/contact-gap outreach
  recommendations — **live-verified** (see Verification below):
  `daysSinceSubstantiveContact` stays `null` for a donor whose only touch
  is `role='recipient'`, even though `daysSinceLastContact` updates.
- Participant touches and every existing single-donor interaction type
  continue to count as substantive contact, unchanged.
- One role applies to the whole shared activity in v1 (not per-donor).
- Bulk activity creation never automatically creates reminders or
  recommendations, for any recipient — live-verified.
- Single-donor interaction entry remains on the existing
  `POST /api/interactions` / `PATCH /api/interactions/[id]` path,
  untouched.
- The multi-donor shared route (`/api/interactions/shared`) only engages
  for 2+ donors.
- Photo is not a separate interaction type — represented by its real
  channel + summary text (e.g. "Text Message" with the photo described in
  the note). This also governs Text Message: WhatsApp/iMessage/SMS/photo
  are all subchannels of the one `text` type, never their own type.
- Backend recipient cap: 200 donors per shared activity.
- Large-selection UI confirmation begins at 15 selected donors (never
  blocks the save) — live-verified with 16 selected.
- **Text Message is now a real, implemented interaction type** — canonical
  DB value `text`, display label "Text Message". `interactions.type` has
  no CHECK constraint in the live schema (enforcement is application-level
  only, via the `kinds`/`KINDS`/`allowedKinds` validation sets), so only
  `shared_activities.type`'s CHECK required a migration (0031) to widen.
  Both TypeScript enums are kept in sync by convention, not by a shared DB
  constraint — see the doc comments on both columns in `db/schema.ts`.
- Text Message role/scoring semantics are NOT special-cased: the existing
  generic role-based rule above (`role='recipient'` = broadcast,
  `role='participant'` = substantive) applies to Text Message exactly like
  every other type, with no per-type branch — live-verified directly at
  the data layer (see Verification below). Text Message defaults to
  `role='recipient'` in the multi-donor picker (`ROLE_DEFAULT_BY_KIND` in
  `CaptureExperience.tsx`), remaining overridable to `participant` via the
  existing role picker.
- `continue_conversation` (in `lib/relationships/recommendation-candidates.ts`)
  now only fires when the most recent completed interaction's note
  contains real commitment language (reused from
  `relationshipSnapshotDetails` in `lib/capture/interaction.ts`) — no
  longer on the mere existence of a recent touch. Its eligibility window
  (≤30 days) and every other candidate/the scoring formula in
  `recommendation-rank.ts` are unchanged. When it doesn't fire and
  nothing else applies, the recommendation is honestly `null` — the UI's
  existing "No suggested action available" / "None available" copy
  covers that, no new fallback string was added.
- The donor page's shared-activity row now offers a separate
  "Add note for this donor" action (a plain link to
  `/capture?donorId=...`, same prefill convention as the page's own
  "+ Log interaction" link) alongside "Edit shared activity". This is
  structurally guaranteed to create only an ordinary single-donor
  interaction (`shared_activity_id`/`role` both null) — the single-donor
  `POST /api/interactions` route never references `shared_activities`.
  "Detach and customize" was NOT built; not needed given this reuse.
- Relationship intelligence quality gate (see Latest Completed Task): a
  generated fact/action must be specific, donor-relevant, and grounded in
  the actual note — never a generic channel/type label, never a
  sentence-start verb misclassified as a person, never boilerplate
  generated only because a note exists. Enforced with deterministic
  regex/keyword rules in `lib/capture/interaction.ts`, not an opaque
  scoring system. `specificFacts` (real quoted sentences) replaced the
  old category-label `topics` field; `recommendedNextAction` is `null`,
  not a manufactured placeholder, when no commitment sentence parsed.
  Quality enforcement lives entirely at the extraction/generation layer
  (`actionableRelationshipSnapshot`) — consuming code (recommendation
  engine, donor page, Meeting Brief, Assistant, capture preview) was NOT
  redesigned, it just correctly handles the now-nullable
  `relationshipSummary`/`recommendedNextAction`.

## Database / Migration State

Migration `0030_shared_activities.sql`:
**APPLIED** to `fundraising-os-staging-db` (Independent Staging) on
2026-08-19. (See prior verification detail in git history of this file —
unchanged since, not re-verified in this update.)

Migration `0031_interactions_text_type.sql`:
**APPLIED** to `fundraising-os-staging-db` (Independent Staging) on
2026-08-18.

Applied via `wrangler d1 execute fundraising-os-staging-db --remote --file
drizzle/0031_interactions_text_type.sql --config wrangler.staging.jsonc`.
7 statements executed (58 rows written — the 2 pre-existing
`shared_activities` rows being rebuilt with the widened CHECK). Verified
directly against `sqlite_schema` pre/post: `interactions`'s own table DDL
and all 3 of its indexes (`interactions_donor_date_idx`,
`interactions_shared_activity_idx`,
`interactions_shared_activity_donor_uidx`) were confirmed present and
untouched (this migration never rebuilds that table — it has no CHECK
constraint to widen); `shared_activities`'s CHECK now reads `type IN
('call','email','meeting','visit','note','personal','gift','text')` and
its index (`shared_activities_user_date_idx`) survived the rebuild;
row counts unchanged pre/post (`interactions`=12, `shared_activities`=2).

No migration beyond 0031 exists or has been applied. Both the mobile UX
fixes task and the relationship-intelligence quality pass (current HEAD)
are application-layer only — no schema change, no migration.

## Deployment State

**Live.** Deployed commit `1487a8bb4416666e79a8d94d571e3445af3fc2af`,
Worker version `f5c3430d-1b04-4dd8-9f72-8a0fcd835e6a`, confirmed via
`wrangler deployments list` showing it as the 100% current deployment.

Worker: `fundraising-os-staging`
URL: `https://fundraising-os-staging.sgoldstein.workers.dev`
D1: `fundraising-os-staging-db` (bound as `env.DB`)

Multi-donor shared activities (Phase 1 + Phase 2), Text Message, the
mobile UX fixes, and the relationship-intelligence quality pass are all
live and have been exercised end-to-end against real staging data (see
Verification).

Note: this deploy required two retries — the environment's network/DNS
had a transient outage (wrangler/curl/nslookup all failed to resolve
`dash.cloudflare.com`/`api.cloudflare.com` for several minutes); the
deploy succeeded once connectivity returned, verified independently via
`wrangler deployments list` in the same session before live-testing.

## Verification

**Automated (local):**
pnpm test: PASS (all suites)
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit: PASS
pnpm run build:staging-independent: PASS

**Live, on Independent Staging (2026-08-19), using two real donor pairs
from the actual staging roster, all created via the deployed
`/api/interactions/shared` API and cleaned up afterward:**

- 2-recipient shared activity: parent + 2 linked `interactions` rows
  created, both `role='recipient'`, 2 "added" audit rows, both donor
  timelines showed "Sent to 2 donors" with the canonical summary, Last
  Contact updated for both. **Scoring rule confirmed directly at the data
  layer**: the substantive-contact query (excludes `role='recipient'`)
  returned no row for the test donor even after the touch, while the
  all-types Last Contact query did — proving `reconnect_contact_gap` is
  not suppressed by a recipient-only touch. No recommendation/reminder row
  was created (`recommendations` count stayed at 4 throughout).
- 2-participant shared activity: parent + 2 linked rows, both
  `role='participant'`, timeline/Meeting Brief showed "2 participants",
  Last Contact updated, and the substantive-contact query **did** return a
  row for these donors (proving a participant touch counts as substantive,
  as designed). No auto-reminder created.
- Edit: one `PATCH` updated only `shared_activities.summary`; both linked
  donors' timelines immediately showed the new text; the per-row
  `interactions.summary` columns were confirmed unchanged (no fan-out
  write).
- Remove one recipient: only that donor's `interactions` row was
  soft-cancelled (`source` → `cancelled:...`); the other donor's row and
  the parent were untouched; `recipient_count` decremented 2→1; exactly
  one "removed" audit row was added; the removed donor's Last Contact
  correctly reverted to "None recorded".
- Delete whole activity: performed on both test activities. Every
  still-linked row was cancelled and `shared_activities.deleted_at` was
  set on both. Final sweep confirmed zero active `shared_activities` rows
  and zero active `interactions` rows still pointing at a
  `shared_activity_id` — no test data left active.
- Mobile: **functional** behavior verified live (mode toggle, live donor
  search/multi-select with no duplicates, role picker with type-based
  defaults, 15+/16-selected large-selection confirmation showing the exact
  approved wording and not auto-saving) all confirmed working on the
  deployed app. The **narrow-viewport visual** check (actual small-screen
  layout) could not be completed — the browser-automation tooling's window
  resize did not change the rendered viewport in this environment (stayed
  ~1280×720 regardless of the requested size). The responsive CSS rules
  themselves (chip wrapping, `@media (max-width:760px)` stacking for the
  picker/role/confirm UI) are already asserted present and passing in
  `tests/shared-activity-ux.test.mjs`, but true small-screen visual QA is
  still outstanding — see Outstanding Work.

**One live-testing observation, not a defect:** on a donor's very first
logged interaction (of ANY type — recipient, participant, or an ordinary
single-donor touch), the `continue_conversation` recommendation becomes
eligible (it only requires *some* completed interaction to exist) and
generally outranks `reconnect_contact_gap` in the "Suggested Action"
slot, even when the underlying touch is a broadcast. This is pre-existing
ranking behavior in `recommendation-rank.ts`, identical regardless of
role, and was explicitly out of scope for the Phase 1 approved rule
(which is specifically about `reconnect_contact_gap`'s own suppression
logic, confirmed correct above). Net effect: the "Last Contact recent +
reconnect_contact_gap clarifier" UI scenario is rarer in practice than
it might seem, because `continue_conversation` tends to win once any
interaction has ever been logged. Not changed as part of this rollout;
flagged for a future decision if desired.

All test interactions/shared-activities have been soft-cancelled/deleted;
none are active. `interactions` table now has 12 rows total (8 original +
4 test rows, all 4 now cancelled, never hard-deleted).

**Live, Text Message rollout (2026-08-18), using two real donors from the
actual staging roster, both created via the deployed app UI and cleaned up
afterward:**

- Single-donor Text Message: created for "Dr. & Mrs. Yaakov Abdelhak" via
  the single-donor capture form. Confirmed at the data layer: `type =
  'text'`, `role = NULL`, `shared_activity_id = NULL`. Timeline badge
  read "Completed · Text Message" (friendly label, never the raw enum
  value) and "Last meaningful contact" updated to the capture date.
- Shared Text Message, `role='recipient'`, 2 donors ("Mr. & Mrs. Ari
  Abramovitz", "Mr. & Mrs. Shaya Abramson"): the multi-donor picker
  defaulted the role toggle to "Recipients" the instant Text Message was
  selected (no manual step needed), matching the approved default.
  Confirmation screen read "Sent to 2 donors" / "Text Message on Aug 18,
  9:42 PM" and explicitly stated Last Contact was updated but the touch
  "does not, by itself, count as a substantive-contact touch" and that
  "No reminders were created." **Verified directly against
  `fundraising-os-staging-db`, not just the UI**: both `interactions` rows
  had `type='text'`, `role='recipient'`, the same `shared_activity_id`;
  the plain Last-Contact query (`MAX(occurred_at)`, no role filter)
  returned the touch timestamp for both donors; the exact production
  substantive-contact query (same query, `AND (role IS NULL OR role !=
  'recipient')`) returned **zero rows** for both donors, proving the
  recipient touch does not suppress `reconnect_contact_gap`; a query
  against `recommendations` for either donor with an open, text-related
  row returned 0 — no automatic reminder was created.
- No per-type branch exists anywhere in the scoring path — the SQL
  condition that excludes `role='recipient'` from
  `lastSubstantiveContactAt` (in `lib/workspace/live-data.ts`) is entirely
  type-agnostic, so this behavior is structural, not something that could
  regress for Text Message specifically without also breaking every other
  shared type.
- Cleanup: the single-donor row was archived via `DELETE
  /api/interactions/:id` (`action: "archive"`) and the shared activity was
  deleted via `DELETE /api/interactions/shared/:id` (`action:
  "delete-activity"`) — both are the app's own normal routes (invoked
  directly rather than by clicking the UI's confirm-dialog buttons, to
  avoid a blocking native `window.confirm()` in browser automation; the
  server-side effect is identical to clicking through). Final state
  confirmed via SQL: all 3 test rows now read `source =
  'archived:capture:text'` or `source = 'cancelled:manual'` — soft
  ended, never hard-deleted, consistent with every other cleanup in this
  project.

**Live, Mobile UX fixes rollout (2026-08-18), against real staging donors
and a real shared activity, cleaned up afterward:**

- **RecipientPicker overlap**: `resize_window` does not change the true
  rendered viewport in this environment (confirmed: `window.innerWidth`
  stayed 1280 after requesting 390×844) — same limitation as the prior
  session. Instead, the real `.content` container was narrowed to 375px
  via direct DOM style (same layout engine, same real CSS cascade, just a
  narrowed element instead of a narrowed window — valid for this bug
  since none of the relevant grid rules are viewport-media-query-gated).
  Before the fix: searching "Rosen" showed severely overlapping rows
  (`firstRow.offsetHeight` was 49px while `firstRow.scrollHeight` — the
  content's actual required height — was 175px). After deploying the
  fix: rows are fully separated, each row's height matches its own
  content, secondary metadata truncates to one line
  ("58252 · drose…" instead of wrapping across 3+ lines).
- Selected-donor state confirmed live: tapping a result shows a
  checkmark, green highlight, and "1 selected" with a chip below.
- **Shared-activity edit warning**: opening "Edit shared activity" on a
  real 2-donor activity showed, verbatim: "This change affects all 2
  donors linked to this activity -- it edits the one shared summary,
  type, and date, not just this donor's copy," in a visually distinct
  amber box, and the save button read "Save for all 2 donors".
- **Donor-specific note**: clicking "Add note for this donor" navigated
  to `/capture?donorId=...` prefilled with the correct donor in
  single-donor mode. After saving, verified directly against D1: exactly
  one new `interactions` row, `donor_id` = the one donor, `role`/
  `shared_activity_id` both `NULL`. The shared activity's own row was
  re-queried afterward and its `summary`/`recipient_count` (2) and both
  linked donors' `role='participant'` were unchanged.
- **Suggested Action wording**: reproduced the exact originally-reported
  case (a Text Message interaction with note "Text message", no
  commitment language) — Suggested Action showed "None available" /
  "No suggested action available" in place of the old "Continue the
  conversation from the recent text about 'Text message'."
- **Mobile Suggested Action layout**: with the `.content` container
  narrowed to 375px and the exact shipped CSS rule applied, the three
  numeric KPI tiles (Lifetime Paid, Most Recent Paid Gift, Open
  Commitments) rendered as compact columns in one row, and Suggested
  Action spanned the full width beneath them with room for natural
  prose — confirmed visually via screenshot.
- Cleanup: all 3 test rows (the shared activity + its 2 links, plus the
  donor-specific note) archived/cancelled via the app's own routes,
  confirmed via SQL (`source` = `archived:capture:email` /
  `cancelled:manual`), never hard-deleted.

**Live, relationship-intelligence quality pass (2026-08-19), using one
real staging donor ("Mr. & Mrs. Ari Abramovitz"), all three interactions
created via the deployed app UI and cleaned up afterward:**

- Generic Text Message, no meaningful fact ("Messaged about the building
  fund update."): capture preview showed "No meaningful relationship
  details detected." with no checkbox; saved with no "Relationship
  snapshot refreshed" confirmation ("Relationship snapshot unchanged —
  The generated draft was not accepted, so it was not saved." instead).
  Confirmed directly in D1: `donors.relationship_summary` /
  `institutional_memory` stayed `NULL`.
- Real fact ("Ari mentioned that his daughter is starting seminary in
  Israel this fall."): preview showed the plain sentence with the opt-in
  checkbox; checked and saved — confirmed directly in D1 that
  `relationship_summary` is exactly that sentence, no field labels. Donor
  page RELATIONSHIP SNAPSHOT card rendered the same clean sentence;
  SUGGESTED ACTION read "Reach out and reference: [the sentence]" (no
  "what's already known" redundancy, no field-dump echo); evidence read
  `Recorded relationship note: "..."` (never `relationship_summary/
  institutional_memory:`); no `.recommendation-meta` element was even
  present (timing is null for this kind, so nothing renders — confirming
  "Confidence:" is gone). KPI card showed the fixed "Review before next
  outreach" headline.
- Concrete next action ("Will send the updated pledge form by Friday.",
  left unaccepted to isolate this from the fact test above): donor page
  SUGGESTED ACTION read "Send the updated pledge form by Friday." — a
  direct, concise action, matching the task's own "strong example" style
  — both in the detail view and the KPI card, with no truncation needed.
- Cleanup: all 3 test interactions archived via the app's own
  `DELETE /api/interactions/:id` route (`action: "archive"`), confirmed
  via SQL (`source` = `archived:capture:text` / `archived:capture:note`).
  Archiving the 2nd/3rd interaction automatically triggered the existing
  `contextStatement` revert logic in `app/api/interactions/[id]/route.ts`,
  which reset `donors.relationship_summary`/`institutional_memory` back
  to `NULL` (their state before this test) with no manual SQL needed —
  confirmed directly in D1.

## Safety / Infrastructure State

This rollout (shared-activity, Text Message, mobile UX fixes, and
relationship-intelligence quality work):
- D1: migrations 0030 and 0031 applied to `fundraising-os-staging-db`
  only; all read/write operations scoped to that database via `wrangler
  d1 execute --remote`; no other database touched.
- R2: not touched.
- Backup/restore workflows (`.github/workflows/d1-*.yml`): not touched.
- Production: not touched (no production Worker/D1 binding exists in
  `wrangler.staging.jsonc`; confirmed before any write).
- `origin/main`: not touched — checked before and after both the Text
  Message and mobile-UX-fixes rollouts, unchanged at
  `4ea1d5ec98ee2a2ef010154ba02a9ad278aa6a58` throughout.
- No unexpected `recommendations` rows were created at any point
  (checked directly by donor_id + status/action filter after each live
  test — 0 rows).
- `donors`/`giving_activities` row counts unaffected by any of these live
  tests (interactions/shared_activities only).

## Outstanding Work / Known Limitations

- True device/viewport visual QA is still not possible in this
  automation environment (`resize_window` does not change
  `window.innerWidth`). The mobile UX fixes task worked around this by
  narrowing the real `.content` DOM element to 375px and applying the
  exact shipped CSS — a real-cascade, real-layout-engine check that is
  strong evidence but not identical to a true device viewport (it can't
  exercise viewport-media-query-gated rules like the sidebar/nav
  collapse). Recommend a genuine phone/tablet check, or a different
  automation environment, before treating any mobile layout claim here
  as fully pixel-verified.
- The `continue_conversation` vs. `reconnect_contact_gap` ranking
  interaction described above (Verification section, from the earlier
  shared-activity rollout) is unaffected by this task's wording fix and
  remains a real, observed UX nuance worth a product decision if the
  copy ever needs to distinguish "continuing a broadcast" from
  "continuing a real conversation." continue_conversation's ELIGIBILITY
  on a broadcast recipient touch was explicitly not changed in this task
  (only its wording, and only when it does fire) — flagging again per
  the task's own instruction to report rather than silently redesign it.
- Shared-activity recipient list editing beyond "remove one donor" (e.g.
  adding a donor to an already-saved activity) is not built.
- Meeting Brief's other surfaces (discussion topics, people-mentioned)
  are not role-aware — only the "Last Interaction" card is.
- "Add note for this donor" always launches an empty single-donor
  capture form — it does not pre-fill any context from the shared
  activity it was opened from (e.g. the shared summary or date). Not
  requested by this task; worth considering if fundraisers want that
  context carried over.
- Existing (pre-fix) `relationship_summary`/`institutional_memory` rows
  written before this quality pass: 4 of 9 non-null rows were cleaned up
  (regenerated with the current extractor, applied and verified -- see
  "Relationship-Summary Cleanup Audit" above). 5 remain, all investigated
  and left untouched pending a human decision: 3 ("Solicited" false-person
  cases -- Klein/Pfeiffer/Rovinsky) have a real underlying solicitation-
  amount fact the current extractor can't recover on its own; 2
  (Semmelman/Zachter) hinge on a Yahrtzeit/Zman keyword gap the extractor
  doesn't recognize. See Next Approval Required for what's needed to close
  these out.
- The current extractor's `FACT_SIGNAL_PATTERN` has no keyword coverage
  for Yahrtzeit, Zman/yeshiva-timing language, or explicit dollar amounts
  ("$5k", "$10,000"). Investigated in depth (see "Relationship-Summary
  Cleanup Audit" -> "Part C"); recommendation is narrow and category-
  specific, not implemented: Yahrtzeit facts are already durably tracked
  in the dedicated `yahrtzeits` table (don't duplicate into
  relationship_summary); Zman/timing mentions are temporary interaction
  context better handled case-by-case than with a standing keyword;
  solicitation dollar amounts are the one category that currently has
  nowhere else to live in the schema and deserves an explicit product
  decision (either narrow fact-signal support, or a small dedicated
  ask/solicitation field/table).
- Place/holiday names (e.g. "Israel", "Rosh Hashanah") can still appear
  in the `people` array — genuinely ambiguous with real given names in
  this donor community (e.g. "Israel" is also a real first name), so no
  attempt was made to filter them; a full named-entity/place gazetteer
  was judged out of scope for a deterministic-rules-only fix. Confirmed
  low-impact: Meeting Brief's "PEOPLE MENTIONED" card is the only reader
  of this field, and this class of imprecision existed before this task
  too (it doesn't affect the main Relationship Snapshot text, which is
  driven by `specificFacts`, not `people`).
- The fact-signal sentence extraction (`specificFacts`) can occasionally
  promote a sentence that's technically "specific" (contains a signal
  keyword like "family") but still fairly generic in substance (e.g. "A
  nice family update, all is well" would NOT pass — verified null in
  testing — but a borderline case worded differently could). No proper-
  noun/digit specificity filter was added on top, since the task's own
  worked examples (e.g. "Concerned about pledge balance") don't
  consistently contain one either — this was a deliberate trade-off, not
  an oversight.

## Next Approval Required

The 4 approved SAFE_TO_REGENERATE rows are done (applied and verified —
see "Relationship-Summary Cleanup Audit" above). Nothing is blocking; the
following need a human decision before any further write happens to the
5 remaining rows:
1. **Klein / Pfeiffer / Rovinsky** ("Solicited" false-person cases): the
   underlying note has a real solicitation-amount fact
   ("Solicited for a plaque ($5k)." / "Solicited for $10k." / "Solicited
   for a plaque in memory of his wife ($5k)."). Decide whether to
   manually set relationship_summary to that fact for each (recommended —
   see the audit section for exact suggested text), leave as-is, or
   handle differently. Not automated — the current extractor would return
   null for all three if regenerated as-is, which would silently discard
   the ask amount.
2. **Semmelman**: recommend clearing relationship_summary to null (the
   durable fact — wife's Yahrtzeit — is already tracked in the dedicated
   `yahrtzeits` table; this row would just duplicate it). Needs explicit
   confirmation before any write.
3. **Zachter**: more borderline; recommend a human read and a short manual
   value (e.g. "Thanked for supporting the yeshiva's Zman.") or leave
   as-is — lower priority than the other 4.
4. **Extractor expansion** (Part C above): a real product decision on
   whether to add dollar-amount fact-signal support (the one category of
   the three investigated that has no other home in the schema) — not
   implemented, needs its own explicit approval and design if wanted.

Everything else is non-blocking — the shared-activity, Text Message,
mobile UX fixes, and relationship-intelligence quality pass are all live
and verified on Independent Staging.

Optional follow-ups, each would need its own explicit approval before
work begins:
- A genuine device/alternate-tooling mobile visual QA pass to close the
  viewport-emulation gap above.
- A product decision on the `continue_conversation`/`reconnect_contact_gap`
  ranking nuance and/or continue_conversation's eligibility on broadcast
  recipient touches, if judged worth addressing.
- Pre-filling shared-activity context into the new "Add note for this
  donor" capture form, if fundraisers want it.

## Last Updated

2026-08-19T00:00:00Z (approximate)
Claude (Sonnet 5) — Relationship-summary cleanup Phase 2: applied the 4
explicitly-approved SAFE_TO_REGENERATE rows to `fundraising-os-staging-db`
and investigated the 5 NEEDS_REVIEW rows (read-only, not modified). Before
writing, re-verified the 4 rows against a fresh classification (identical
to the original preview — no drift). Extended
`scripts/relationship-summary-cleanup-preview.mjs` with a `--apply
<id1,id2,...>` mode: explicit donor-ID allowlist only, re-classifies fresh
immediately before each write, fails closed if a donor no longer
classifies SAFE_TO_REGENERATE or its stored value changed since the read
(conditional UPDATE, compare-and-swap), writes only relationship_summary,
proposed value always computed server-side from the current extractor —
never a caller-supplied string. Found and fixed two real bugs live during
development: (1) the pre-fix values contain literal newlines, which broke
`wrangler d1 execute --command`'s Windows shell-argument parsing (caught
before any write happened, no data affected); (2) `wrangler d1 execute
--file`'s JSON response `meta.changes` is NOT a trustworthy per-row count
(confirmed live against a no-op query) — switched to hex-blob-encoded
values (`CAST(X'...' AS TEXT)`) under `--command` mode instead, which
does report reliable counts. All 4 applied successfully; post-write
verification confirmed relationship_summary matches the extractor exactly,
institutional_memory and source interactions unchanged, exactly 4 rows
changed table-wide, and a fresh preview run is idempotent (reclassifies
all 4 as ALREADY_GOOD, proposes nothing). Investigated all 5 NEEDS_REVIEW
donors read-only: the 3 "Solicited" cases (Klein/Pfeiffer/Rovinsky) each
have a real solicitation-amount fact in their source note that the
current extractor can't recover (would discard it if auto-regenerated);
Semmelman's Yahrtzeit fact is already tracked in the dedicated
`yahrtzeits` table; Zachter's "Zman" mention is temporary interaction
context. Wrote a narrow, category-specific extractor-expansion
recommendation (not implemented) distinguishing durable facts already
tracked elsewhere (Yahrtzeit — don't duplicate), temporary context (Zman —
handle manually), and giving-adjacent information with no other home
(dollar amounts — the one category worth a real product decision). Added
`tests/relationship-summary-apply.test.mjs` (12-item apply-mode safety
coverage, offline). `pnpm test` and `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` both clean.
Committed and pushed as `7874d6b`. `origin/main` untouched. No Worker
deploy — no application code was touched, this was a data-only operation.
See "Relationship-Summary Cleanup Audit" above for full detail, and Next
Approval Required for what's still open on the 5 remaining rows.

2026-08-19T00:00:00Z (approximate)
Claude (Sonnet 5) — Relationship-summary cleanup AUDIT/PREVIEW/CLASSIFY
pass completed (read-only against `fundraising-os-staging-db`). Built
`scripts/relationship-summary-cleanup-preview.mjs`, reusing the real
production extractor (never reimplemented) to propose regenerated values
and a small frozen legacy-generator block used only to trace old-format
values back to their source note. 9 donors have a non-null
relationship_summary: 4 SAFE_TO_REGENERATE (proposed value shown), 5
NEEDS_REVIEW (left untouched, reasons documented above), 0 SAFE_TO_CLEAR,
0 MANUAL_UNCERTAIN, 0 ALREADY_GOOD. `institutional_memory` audited
separately and confirmed to need no cleanup. Added
`tests/relationship-summary-cleanup-preview.test.mjs` (12-item coverage,
offline against synthetic fixtures) and a `pnpm run
cleanup:relationship-summary-preview` script alias. `pnpm test` and
`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` both clean. Committed and pushed as `fe35859`.
**No D1 writes were performed at any point in this task** — applying the
4 regenerations (and deciding what, if anything, to do about the 5
needs-review rows) is a separate, explicitly-approved next step; see Next
Approval Required above.

2026-08-19T04:35:00Z
Claude (Sonnet 5) — Relationship-intelligence quality pass shipped: fixed
the "Messaged" (and other channel/CRM verbs) misclassified as a person
bug at its root, replaced the generic category-label "topics" field with
real quoted `specificFacts`, made the Relationship Snapshot/capture
preview/Suggested Action all honestly show nothing when extraction found
nothing meaningful instead of boilerplate or a field-label dump, removed
the internal "Confidence:"/raw-field-name leaks from donor-facing UI.
Deployed (commit `1487a8b`, Worker version
`f5c3430d-1b04-4dd8-9f72-8a0fcd835e6a`, confirmed via `wrangler
deployments list` after a transient network/DNS outage delayed the
deploy), live-verified against real staging data (a generic Text Message,
a real fact, and a concrete next action) including direct D1 checks, test
data cleaned up via normal app routes (archiving automatically reverted
the donor's relationship_summary/institutional_memory via existing
`contextStatement` logic — no manual SQL needed), this handoff updated to
reflect live state. Session `session_01DoQiMShaMrVYHvopkVj581`.
